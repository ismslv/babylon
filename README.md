Babylon is a lightweight collaborative translation tool for creative projects ‚Äî cozy, minimal, and in the retro-futuristic style of [The Wizard](thewizard.space).

Use it to organize and collaborate on translations for games, apps, stories, or anything else that needs localization.

Supports multiple languages, fuzzy matches, and a charming pixel-art interface that feels right at home in the TrinketOS universe.

Free to use, easy to host, and ready to help your words cross borders.

3. Create config.json file

5. Change your password in public area
6. Start adding languages and users in admin area

‚∏ª

### Configuration

All settings are in config.json. Use `sample_config.json` as a reference. All settings are optional: without any config, default language will be en and user admin will be created.

Options:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Key</td>
<td>Description</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>project_name</td>
<td>Name of your project (shown in UI).</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>Enable string versioning (true/false).</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>config_csv</td>
<td>CSV-specific settings (delimiter, key column).</td>

</tr>
</table>

Passwords for all users default to their username at first login.
Users can change their password afterwards.

### Development

Modules declare their UI menu via: `public static function menu(): array;`

Example:


```php
public static function menu(): array {
  return [
    ['text', 'PO/POT (gettext) ‚Äî English strings are keys'],
    ['by_lang_import_export', 'import', 'export'],
    ['zip', 'export all languages as .po in zip']
  ];
}

```

Supported menu tags:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Tag</td>
<td>Meaning</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>text</td>
<td>Informational text (placeholders replaced from config)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>import</td>
<td>Generic import</td>
</tr><tr>
